# 🤖 AI Agents — Learning & Implementation Repository

This repository documents my **learning journey and hands-on projects** from the Kaggle [AI Agents Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents).  
The course explores how to design, build, and deploy **intelligent, autonomous agents** capable of perceiving context, reasoning through tasks, and executing real-world actions using Large Language Models (LLMs).

---

## 🧭 Overview

The course provides a **comprehensive, end-to-end framework** for building modern AI agents — from understanding agentic architectures to deploying production-grade systems.  
It bridges **LLM engineering**, **tool interoperability**, **context management**, and **agent evaluation**, helping practitioners build systems that go far beyond single-turn chat models.

### 🧩 What’s Covered

**1. Introduction to Agents**  
Understand the defining characteristics of AI agents and how they differ from traditional LLM applications.  
Learn about the key components of **agentic architectures** — perception, reasoning, memory, and action — that enable autonomous decision-making.

**2. Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP**  
Explore how agents can “take action” by leveraging **external tools, APIs, and functions**.  
Get introduced to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — a standardized way for agents to discover and use interoperable tools.

**3. Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory**  
Learn to build agents that **remember and adapt** by managing both short-term and long-term context.  
Implement session tracking and memory persistence to enable **multi-turn conversations** and **complex task handling**.

**4. Agent Quality**  
Master the disciplines of **evaluation, observability, and performance optimization**.  
Use metrics, logging, and tracing to monitor and improve agent reliability, accuracy, and responsiveness.

**5. Prototype to Production**  
Learn how to **deploy and scale** agents for real-world applications.  
Understand the **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** for creating multi-agent systems that collaborate dynamically in production environments.
